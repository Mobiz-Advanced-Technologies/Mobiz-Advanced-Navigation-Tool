## I want to know more!

Mobiz (formerly known as '日本における武器・エレクトロニクス事業') is a business specializing in electronics, vehicles, entertainment and weaponry for japan to fight against other countries in WW2. Our HQs are originally located around japan. But the incident destroyed our main HQ and caused many of our workers to lose their lives. We made our last decision and fled to the USSR with our remaining workers. The lack of our company has become one of the reason why Japan fell and had to redo their technology, vehicles, weaponry and entertainment from scratch.
